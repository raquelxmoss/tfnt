- Quick intro into who I am

- What I have -- a sign up form, some products

- So, our Robot company here has decided to switch to a new billing software. They're really excited about it, because it's going to save us a lot of time and money, and it's going to be much better for our customers. So that's fantastic. There's one hitch -- it requires a first name and a last name, but up until now, we've just been using a 'Name' field

- So, we're going to add the field to the form, and see what other changes we have to make to the app to keep everything going well.

- Add field to form, discover error.

- Migration

- Data migration, what to do? Demo in IRB

- Discussions on how to solve the problem -- do it with the algorithm, let people edit.
  !!! We don't have an edit function!
  We need to add that to the TODO list!

- Up/Down migration

- Migrate

- Run the tests -- everything is failing wherever #name is used
